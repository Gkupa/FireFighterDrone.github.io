            <h2>Description</h2>
            <div class="tag"></div>
            <p>
                The concept of a fire fighter drone was born out of the increasing number of fire incidents that have occurred in recent years, both in urban and forest environments. In particular, during the summer months, high temperatures have contributed to the rise of local fires such as those caused by burning trash cans or cars. The traditional method of calling the fire department by dialing 112 and waiting for a large fire truck to arrive is often inadequate, especially in heavily congested urban areas. With the potential for a small fire to become a serious problem, a more efficient and effective solution was needed.
To address this issue, we developed a fire fighter drone that is able to quickly maneuver in the city and reach the fire site much faster than a large fire truck. Equipped with a special ball that can extinguish small fires, such as those caused by burning cars or trashcans, this drone is an innovative solution to the problem of urban fires. Furthermore, the drone has a camera that enables it to monitor forest areas, providing an additional layer of safety for communities at risk of wildfires.
While there may be concerns about the safety of using drones in urban areas, we believe that with a larger budget, even greater safety measures could be implemented. As it stands, the drone is capable of extinguishing small fires and scanning for potential fire hazards with the help of a skilled pilot. In addition, our project includes a website where people can learn about the specifications of our fire fighter drone and find other useful information about our project.
Overall, our fire fighter drone is an innovative solution to a growing problem. With the potential to save lives and reduce property damage, we believe that this project has significant potential to make a positive impact on our communities.
 Our project aimed to provide a solution that could assist firefighters in combating small-scale urban fires, particularly during times when large forest fires demand the majority of firefighting resources. In addition, during large forest fires, it is essential to quickly identify and extinguish fire pits to prevent further spreading. To achieve this, we developed a drone that can effectively scan and extinguish fires. The drone is user-friendly and requires only basic training to operate. Its capabilities include moving fire extinguisher balls and releasing them from the air, making it an efficient and effective tool in firefighting operations. This project serves as an innovative solution to support firefighting efforts and minimize the risk of loss of life and property caused by fires.

            <h3>Frame</h3>
            <div class="tag"></div>
            <p>
                The main frame of our drone was the APEX/Mark 7inch model. We chose this specific frame size because we wanted the drone to be able to lift as much weight as possible. Larger propellers were necessary to achieve this, and the 7-inch frame provided sufficient space for us to use these larger propellers. 
To ensure that the drone was as robust as possible, we opted to use carbon fiber as the primary frame material. This material is known for its strength and durability, making it an excellent choice for disaster scenarios where the drone may be subject to crashes or other types of impact. The carbon fiber frame also provides a lightweight design, allowing the drone to be agile and maneuverable.
The attached picture shows the main body and wings of the drone. The design of the frame was carefully considered to provide the necessary support for the electronic components and payload, while also being aerodynamic and efficient. Overall, the APEX/Mark 7inch frame was an ideal choice for our project, providing the necessary strength, size, and weight capacity to meet our specific requirements.
