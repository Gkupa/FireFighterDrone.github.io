          <div class="tag"></div>
          <p>
            Tsotne Mtchedlishvili is one of the computer engineers, primary
            design artists, lead web developer. While contributing greatly to
            the visual and the web development side of the project, he also
            parttook in assembling the drone as well as developing the custom 3D
            pritnted assets for the aircraft. Assembling a drone for a final
            project was a fascinating experience that tested my skills in
            various areas. From designing and taking precise measurements for
            the lower part of the drone to building and publishing our main
            website, I had the opportunity to exercise my creativity, technical
            expertise, and teamwork abilities. In addition to contributing to
            the drone's physical construction, I also played a crucial role in
            mounting the remote transmitter, ensuring that the drone could be
            controlled with precision and ease. Building a 3D model of the lower
            part of the drone for our university final project was no easy feat.
            The task required meticulous precision in pinpointing the exact
            locations for each screw, without the benefit of any pre-existing
            measurements for this unique craft. To complicate matters further,
            our team also determined that the drone camera needed to be mounted
            on the floor, requiring me to create additional space for a servo
            engine. With no space on the default frame for the servo to tilt the
            camera accordingly, I had to use my creative problem-solving skills
            to devise a solution. One of the biggest challenges was building a
            conjunction to hold the dropping mechanism, which needed to be both
            reliable and solid to withstand the weight and pressure it would
            encounter during operation. We had to ensure that the mechanism was
            not only secure but also easy to use, adding to the complexity of
            the project. Despite these challenges, I found the entire experience
            exhilarating, and I am proud to have contributed to a project that
            displays innovation, teamwork, and technical expertise. I created 3D
            model with is shown in report paragraph 3D printed frame by clicking
            here you will be able to see the result. One of the most exciting
            tasks in building our university final project was mounting the
            remote transmitter 'RADIOMASTER Receiver R81' to our flight
            controller. The transmitter had a range of over 1km, which was more
            than sufficient for our project needs. However, the process of
            mounting and configuring the transmitter was not without its
            challenges. I had to carefully connect the special pins RX1, 5V, and
            GND to the flight controller to ensure a reliable connection. After
            mounting the transmitter, the next step was to configure the remote
            controller. This involved following a bind method that required
            pressing and holding a bind button for three seconds. We also needed
            to select the D8 protocol on our remote control, and ensure that the
            receiver's LED flashed a red light to confirm successful binding.
            Finally, we had to connect the transmitter to Beta flight
            configuration, making sure that the receiver was on a serial-based
            connection and that the serial receiver was on SBUS. The process of
            mounting and configuring the remote transmitter was a critical step
            in ensuring the success of our project. We took great care to
            document each step, including screenshots for clarity, in our
            report. It was a challenging but rewarding experience and more

            Throughout the course of designing a Firefighter Drone with the
            ability to monitor and extinguish small local fires, my role
            entailed identifying the optimal frame, installing the FC onto the
            drone, attaching the servo engines, expertly configuring them
            through beta flight configuration and helping with creating our
            website. Such responsibilities were crucial in ensuring the
            successful development and deployment of the Firefighter Drone,
            which ultimately serves as a cutting-edge tool in firefighting
            efforts. When designing our drone, we were faced with the challenge
            of finding the most suitable frame to meet our ambitious goals.
            After extensive research and evaluation, we determined that the
            7-inch Apex/Mark 7 drone frame was the optimal choice. This carbon
            fiber frame boasts exceptional strength and durability, making it
            the ideal solution for our project, as we were seeking to lift as
            much weight as possible within a tight budget. In my role on the
            team, I was tasked with properly assembling the various components
            of the frame, which included implementing changes to the standard
            assembly process to accommodate the custom 3D printed parts that
            were developed by our talented team member, Tsotne Mchedlishvili.
            These modifications were crucial to the overall success of our
            project, as they allowed us to fully integrate the 3D printed parts
            into the drone's design, enabling us to achieve our desired

            engines that could be remotely controlled. Despite encountering some
            initial setbacks with the typical instructions not having pre-made
            pins for our servo engines, I remained determined to find a solution
            that would allow us to meet our project's requirements. Using the
            Diatone Mamba F722APP Stack FPV FC and ESC Flight controller, I
            carefully identified the pins that would enable us to achieve our
            desired functionality. The first servo engine was mounted on a LED
            pin, which had its own timer and was the most reliable option
            available. However, the second engine presented a new challenge, as
            there were no available LED pins. Undeterred, I continued my search
            for an alternative pin that also had its own timer. Eventually, I
            discovered that our controller supported the PPN pin, which I
            successfully mounted the second engine. Throughout the installation
            process, I also made use of the controller's various voltage and
            ground pins to ensure that the servo engines were receiving the
            proper power supply. Overall, this experience highlighted the
            importance of creative problem solving and resourcefulness in the
            face of technical challenges. For our university final project, the

            powerful Beta flight configuration software, I was able to make
            several crucial changes to our flight controller. One of the most
            important changes I implemented was enabling servo tilt, a function
            that allows us to stabilize the gimbal on both pitch and roll axes.
            This feature proved to be essential to our project, as it enabled us
            to precisely control the camera and drop objects from the drone with
            ease. To achieve this, I utilized the Command Line Interface (CLI)
            feature of the Beta flight configuration software. By inputting
            specific commands, I was able to customize the default pins of the
            flight controller to align with our project's unique needs. This
            step is explained in our report in Drone Configuration part.
            Overall, this experience further emphasized the importance of
            understanding and utilizing advanced software tools in the field of
            drone design and engineering. By effectively leveraging the power of
            Beta flight configuration, we were able to customize our drone's
